## Jira Administration Part 1 Introduction 

Many labs have optional exercises. These are not required to be done to complete the course. 
However, if you have time and interest, they supplement the exercises for the lab. 
There are also appendices, which you donâ€™t need during class. They are full of useful information 
like additional reading and best practices. Dig into this section after class! 
You'll log in as various users throughout the course. Here's a list of the users and what role 
they'll have. 

| Name               | Role                               |  
|--------------------|-------------------------------------
| Site administrator | Was provided to you by your trainer (Jira Login)|
| Dakota Jones       | Jira administrator                 |
| Sophie Nguyen      | Development project administrator  | 
| Luis Beck          |Development project member          |
| Max Taylor         | Software developer                 |

To log in during the labs, you need your assigned site URL and each user's email address and 
password. Your instructor will provide 
you this information. 
* Note: The password for every account you use in these labs is the same. Keep this 
password easily accessible. 
* Note: When switching between products in these labs, you'll be able to see other sites. 

It's important that you choose the product on the site that's been assigned to you. 
The language you see in the Atlassian product Ul is set to your browser's language. If you wish 
to see the UI in English (to match the lab instructions), or in a different language, go to your 
Atlassian user profile and edit your account preferences. 
Because the Cloud products are constantly being updated with new features, you may see 
some slight differences between the instructions in this lab workbook and the product you are 
using.
