##  Lab 8 Exercise 2 Edit Project Details 
1. Click `Project settings` (or the cog icon) at the bottom of the project sidebar to access the project's settings pages. 
* **Note**: Jira has two types of administration pages - Jira administration and project settings pages. The Jira administration pages cover the whole Jira product. These you access from the cog icon (Settings) in the main menu or by typing '.' (period) or gg then the name of the page. The project settings pages only apply to the project. 
2. On the projectâ€™s `Details` page, click the current avatar or `select image` next to it. 
3. In the project avatar dialog, click any icon. 
* **Note**: It's good to have an avatar that is representative of your project. If none of the supplied avatars suit your purposes, you can upload your own image. 
4. Optionally enter a Description: `Manage work for Planets app`. 
* **Note**: The Description is optional, but is useful, especially if you have many projects. 
5. For Project lead, start typing `sophie` and select `Sophie Nguyen`. 
* **Note**: The project lead is the person who manages the project within and outside Jira. By default, Jira assigns the person who created the project. We'll discuss project roles in more detail in the next module. 
6. Leave Default Assignee as `Unassigned`. 
7. Click `Save details`. 
8. You should now see your new project avatar at the top of the project sidebar.
