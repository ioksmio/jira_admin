## Lab 5 Exercise 2 Brand your Jira
1. Change the application title:
a. Navigate to the `General configuration` Jira administration page (under `System`) and click `Edit Settings`.
b. Change the Application title to `TIS Jira`.
c. Click `Update` at the bottom of the page. (We'll enable this in the next step.)
2. Change the look and feel:
a. Navigate to the `Look and feel` Jira administration page (under System). b. In the Logo section, click `Browse` (or Choose File).
c. Go to the location on your local drive where you saved the lab file you received with your course materials and open `TIS.png`.
d. Click `Upload Logo`.
e. Scroll down and for Title, check `Show on dashboard sidebar` and click `Update`.
* **Question**: What changed?
* **Answer**: The Teams In Space logo now appears in the top left, and now the site title, `TIS Jira`, appears near your logo. f. Scroll down to the `Favicon` section.
* **Note**: Here, you can also update the favicon (the icon that appears in the browser tab). We'll leave it at the default of the Jira icon as it's a handy way for users to see quickly if the tab is Jira or another product such as Confluence.
g. Optionally, change the menu colors.
i. Scroll down to the `Navigation colors` section.
ii. Click the color square next to `Background`.
iii. Choose your new color and click `Update`. Then refresh the page.
* **Note**: Ensure you keep accessibility in mind when changing the colors, especially the contrast between the background and the text/icon colors. Go to https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ to check you're meeting accessibility standards.
h. You can also update date / time formats. Leave these at the defaults.
i. If you like the new look and feel, keep it. Or, you can revert to the defaults:
i. In the Logo section, click `Reset to Default` next to the new logo. 
ii. Uncheck `Show on dashboard sidebar` and click `Update`.
iii. In the `Navigation colors` section, if there are any `Revert` buttons next to any of the colors, click each of the Revert buttons.
iv. Refresh the page.
v. Navigate to the `General configuration` Jira administration page (under
System) and change the Application title back to `Jira`.
* **Note**: For the rest of this Lab Workbook, the screenshots will reflect the default look and feel.
