## Lab 3 Exercise 2 Configuring Site Access Settings 
##### 1. From site administration, click ```Site access``` in the sidebar. Here you control how users get access to your site. 
##### 2. Generate an invitation URL:
> a. Click ```Invite links```
> 
> b. Click the button next to Confluence (if it's not already enabled). 
> * Note: You can copy this URL and send it to anyone so they can get access to a 
product quickly. 
>
> c. Click `Create a new invite link for Confluence`. 
> * Note the message that the previous link stops working, and the new link starts working immediately. 
>
> d. Click `Create`. Now you see a new Link. 
>
> e. Uncheck `Confluence`. The link is now disabled. 


##### 3. Control whether users can invite others: 
> a. Click `User invites`.
> 
> b. `Check Existing users can send invitations to anyone` (if it's not already enabled). 
Now any user on your site can invite new users.
> 
> c. If you made a change, click `Save changes`. 
##### 4. Controlling who can join your site: 
> a. Click `Approved domains`. 
> * Note: Here we control who can join your site. Currently, no domains are 
approved so all users need to request access or be invited. 
>
> b. Check `Approve any domain`.
> * Note: Site visitors can now immediately create their own accounts. Your site is now public. You can choose whether to get notified every time a new user gets access to your site by checking the 'Notify all site admins when a new user joins with an approved domain' setting. You should consider the number of users your license supports when deciding whether to allow anyone to join your site. 
> * Note: If you check Approve the following domains and enter one, then any user with an email address in that domain can join the site. You'll automatically be notified about any new user. 
c. Recheck Don't approve any domain. You don't need to save as these are the riginal settings. We'll invite users in the next lab. 
Congratulations on completing the lab!
