## Best Practices
| Pitfall  | Example Use Case | Best Practice |
|---|---|---| 
| You are spending too much time changing product access. | You are giving users access to products on an individual level. A large number of users now needs access to another product. You have to update each user's product access individually. | Generally, it's preferable to use groups wherever possible to lessen your administrative load. Rather than updating multiple users as things change you can just update the group.|
|You run out of licensed users.|You invited many users but some of them don't need access to Jira and so never accepted your invitation.|Be wary of inviting too many users if you don't have a lot of licensed users. If you invite a user, even if they don't accept or even log in, they become a billable user.|
