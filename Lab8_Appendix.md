## Best Practices
| Pitfall  | Example Use Case | Best Practice |
|---|---|---| 
|Creating a long difficult to remember project key results in users getting frustrated because they cannot easily search for issues. | You created the key HMN_RSS for the new Human Resources project but users of this project are complaining because they can't remember the key to easily find issues. | You can change the default project key but if you do, choose a key that's descriptive and easy to type. Users will often use the issue key to find issues and you want to make it as easy as possible for them. Don't use overly long keys. |
|Can't find projects easily. |We have hundreds of projects but some of the names are very short and cryptic and they don't have descriptions, so we can't find the projects easily. |If you're going to have a lot of projects and a lot of project schemes, always use a descriptive name and add a description so you can easily see what each one is. |
|Screens that contain too many fields will make users frustrated and they'll skip filling out important fields. |Users are frustrated with filling out a long Create Issue screen as there are too many fields and they don't know what half of them are. So, they just leave most of them blank and you miss out on getting data on some of the important fields, so gadgets and reports don't work well. |Remove unused fields to help simplify the screens for users and make them easier to use. |
