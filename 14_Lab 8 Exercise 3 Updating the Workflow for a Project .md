##  Lab 8 Exercise 3 Updating the Workflow for a Project
> The default workflows for project templates are provided to you as a starting point. In many cases, they may be sufficient but often you'll need to modify them to suit your business needs. 

1. Update the workflow by configuring the board: 
> a. Click `Back to project` in the project sidebar and view the project's board. 
* **Note**: Each column on the board represents a status in the workflow - BACKLOG, SELECTED FOR DEVELOPMENT, IN PROGRESS, AND DONE. 

> b. Click the three dots on the top right of the page and select `Board settings`. 
* **Note**: Here you can add, remove, reorder and rename columns (which are based on workflow statuses). Note it indicates this is a simplified workflow so issues can move from any column to any other column. 

2. Teams in Space want to remove Selected for Development and add a Review column. 
>a. Click `Columns`. 

>b. In the Selected for Development column, click the `Delete icon`. 

>c. In the Unmapped Statuses column, click `X` then `Remove` to delete the SELECTED FOR DEVELOPMENT status from the workflow. 

>d. Click `Add column`: 

>i. Name: `Review` 

>ii. Category: `In Progress` 

>iii. Click `Add` 

* **Note**: The Review column is added along with the REVIEW status (which already exists in Jira). 

>e. Grab the grey dots at top of the Review column and see how you can move the column. Place it back between In Progress and Done. 

>f. Click `Back to board` and view the new workflow. 

>g. `Create a new issue` in the Planets App project: 

> i. Issue type: `Story` 

> ii. Summary: `Test 1` 

> iii. Click `Create` 

> iv. Move the issue around on the board and confirm you can move it from 
any column to any other column. 

3. Viewing the workflow: 
> a. Go to project settings and click `Workflows` in the sidebar. 
* **Note**: In the project's workflow scheme, this workflow applies to all issue types in the project. 

> b. Click `diagram` next to `Software Simplified Workflow for Project`. 
* **Note**: Here you see a diagrammatic representation of the default workflow for this project. 

> c. Close the dialog. 

> d. Click the `Edit` icon under Actions. 
* **Note**: You can use the advanced workflow editor to edit workflows but this is typically done for more complex workflows that are not using the simplified workflow. 

> e. Don't make any changes here. Click `Discard Draft` then `Discard`. 

> f. Click `Back to project` to return to the project board. 
* **Note**: You can also move issues through the workflow by selecting a new status here. 

> i. Click `View workflow`. 
* **Note**: When you have projects with more than one workflow, this is a quick way to see which workflow an issue is using. 

> j. Close the dialog then close the issue view.
