##  Lab 8 Exercise 3 Updating the Workflow for a Project
> The default workflows for project templates are provided to you as a starting point. In many cases, they may be sufficient but often you'll need to modify them to suit your business needs. 

1. Update the workflow by configuring the board: 
a. Click `Back to project` in the project sidebar and view the project's board. 
* **Note**: Each column on the board represents a status in the workflow - BACKLOG, SELECTED FOR DEVELOPMENT, IN PROGRESS, AND DONE. 
b. Click the three dots on the top right of the page and select `Board settings`. 
* **Note**: Here you can add, remove, reorder and rename columns (which are based on workflow statuses). Note it indicates this is a simplified workflow so issues can move from any column to any other column. 
2. Teams in Space want to remove Selected for Development and add a Review column. 
a. Click `Columns`. 
b. In the Selected for Development column, click the `Delete icon`. 
c. In the Unmapped Statuses column, click `X` then `Remove` to delete the SELECTED 
FOR DEVELOPMENT status from the workflow. 
d. Click `Add column`: 
i. Name: `Review` 
ii. Category: `In Progress` 
iii. Click `Add` 
* **Note**: The Review column is added along with the REVIEW status (which already exists in Jira). 
e. Grab the grey dots at top of the Review column and see how you can move the 
column. Place it back between In Progress and Done. 
f. Click `Back to board` and view the new workflow. 
g. `Create a new issue` in the Planets App project: 
i. Issue type: `Story` 
ii. Summary: `Test 1` 
iii. Click `Create` 
iv. Move the issue around on the board and confirm you can move it from any 
column to any other column. 
3. Viewing the workflow: 
a. Go to project settings and click `Workflows` in the sidebar. 
* **Note**: In the project's workflow scheme, this workflow applies to all issue types in the project. 
b. Click `diagram` next to `Software Simplified Workflow for Project`. 
* **Note**: Here you see a diagrammatic representation of the default workflow for this project. 
c. Close the dialog. 
d. Click the `Edit` icon under Actions. 
* **Note**: You can use the advanced workflow editor to edit workflows but this is typically done for more complex workflows that are not using the simplified workflow. 
e. Don't make any changes here. Click `Discard Draft` then `Discard`. 
f. Click `Back to project` to return to the project board. 
* **Note**: You can also move issues through the workflow by selecting a new status here. 
i. Click `View workflow`. 
* **Note**: When you have projects with more than one workflow, this is a quick way to see which workflow an issue is using. 
j. Close the dialog then close the issue view.
