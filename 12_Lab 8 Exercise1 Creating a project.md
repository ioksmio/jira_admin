##  Lab 8 Exercise1 Creating a project
> When you create a new project, you will be asked to create it in one of two ways. This is dependent on the environment version that you are logged into. For this reason, in the first part of the lab, you'll be offered two options for creating your project.

#### Create a company-managed project:
Teams in Space want a Kanban project to manage its development tasks.
1. Log in to your cloud site as the Jira administrator, `Dakota Jones`.
a. If you're not already on the Project page, click `Projects` in the menu and select `View all projects`.
b. In the menu click `Projects` then select `Create project`.
c. If you see this screen then `follow the instructions in this step`. If you see a different screen, follow the instructions in `step 2`.

d. Ensure `Software development` is selected in the sidebar. 
e. Select `Kanban`. 
f. Click `Use template`. 
g. Click `Select a company-managed project`. 
h. Name the project `Planets App`. 
i. Leave the key at `PA`. 
j. Leave `Share settings with an existing project` unchecked. 
k. Click `Create`. 
2. If you see this screen, `follow the instructions in this step`: 

a. Name the project `Planets App`. 
b. Leave the key at `PA`. 
c. Leave `Share settings with an existing project` unchecked. 
d. If the Kanban template is not already selected, click Change template. 
e. From the dropdown, select `Software`. 
f. For the Kanban template, click `Select`.  
g. Click `Create`.
* **Note on creating projects:**
1. The key is used as the prefix of this project's issue keys. For example, your first issue's key will be PA-1. If there are multiple words in the project name, the key will be filled in with the first letter of each of the words in the name. 
2. You can change the default project key that’s created for you, but if you do, choose a key that’s descriptive and easy to type. Users will often use the issue key to find an issue and you want to make it as easy as possible for them so don't use overly long keys. The key can be changed after project creation, but it's better to start off with a suitable one. 
3. The Share settings with an existing project setting lets you share project configurations such as issue types, workflow, and more with other projects. If a change is made to one of the projects’ configurations, that change affects all the projects that share that configuration.
