##  Lab 8 Exercise1 Creating a project
> When you create a new project, you will be asked to create it in one of two ways. This is dependent on the environment version that you are logged into. For this reason, in the first part of the lab, you'll be offered two options for creating your project.

#### Create a company-managed project:
Teams in Space want a Kanban project to manage its development tasks.
1. Log in to your cloud site as the Jira administrator, `Dakota Jones`.
a. If you're not already on the Project page, click `Projects` in the menu and select `View all projects`.
b. In the menu click `Projects` then select `Create project`.
c. If you see this screen then `follow the instructions in this step`. If you see a different screen, follow the instructions in `step 2`.
